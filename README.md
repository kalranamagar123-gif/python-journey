# python-journey
This repository document is my daily Python learning journey, startig form basic programming concepts to advance python and AI-related development.

## Why this repository?
- To build strong programming fundamentals
- To practice Python consistently
- To create real projects, not just watch tutorials
- To prepare for AI and machine learning engineering

## Structure (will grow over time)
- day01_basics → variables, input/output
- day02_conditions → if/else, comparisons
- day03_loops → for, while loops
- projects → small Python projects

## Rules I follow
- Code daily
- Commit every learning session
- Write clean and understandable code

## Goal
Become a professional Python programmer and transition into AI engineering.
